    <h1>Testing Algorithms</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1: Fundamentals (p.16)</h2>
    <p>1. Setting and Swappting- set myNum to 42. Set myName to your name. Now swap myNum and myName.</p>
    <p>2. Print -52 to 1066: print integers from -52 to 1066 using a FOR loop</p>
    <p>3. Don't Worry, Be Happy: Create beCheerful(). Within it, console.log string "good morning!" Call it 98 times.</p>
    <p>4. Multiples of Three- but Not All: Using a for loop, print multiples of 3 from -300 to 0. skip -3 and -6.</p>
    <p>5. Printing Itegers with While: Print integers from 2000 to 5280, using a while loop</p>
    <p>6. You Say It's Your Birthday: If 2 given numbers represent your birth onth and day in either order, log "How did you know?", else log "Just another day..."</p>
    <p>7. Print and Count: Print all integer multiples of 5, from 512 to 4096. afterwards, log how many there were. </p>
    <p>8. Multiples of Six: Print multiples of 6 up to 60,000, using a While Loop</p>
    <p>9. Counting, the Dojo Way: print integers 1 to 100. If divisible by 5, print "coding" instead. If by 10, also print "dojo"</p>
    <p>10. What do you know?: Your function will be given an input parameter "incoming". console.log this value.</p>
    <p>11. Whoa, That Sucker's Huge: add odd integers from -300,000 to 300,000, and console.log the final sum. is there a shortcut?</p>
    <p>12. Countdown by Fours: Log positive numbers starting at 2016, counting down by fours (exclude 0), witout a for loop.</p>
    <p>13. Leap Year: Write a function that determines whether a given year is a lea year. If a year is divisible by four, it is a leap year, unless it is divisible by 100. However, if it is divisible by 400 then it is.</p>
    <p>14. Flexible Counting: based on the earlier "countdown by fours", given lowNum, highNum, mult, print multiples of mult from highNum dow to lowNum, using a for loop. </p>
    <p>15. The Final Countdown: based on flexible countdown. the parameter names are not as helpful, but the problem is identical. given 4 parameters(param1, param2, param3, param4), print multiples of param1, starting at param2 and extending to param3.
        one exception, if the multiples equal param4, then skip it. do this using a while loop.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 1 Fundamentals (p. 20)</h2>
    <p>1. Countdown: create a function that accepts a number as an input. Return a new array that counts down by one, from the number(as array's 'zeroth' element down to 0 (as the last element). How long is this array?</p>
